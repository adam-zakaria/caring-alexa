Yes, a single developer account can manage multiple Alexa devices, but there are some important considerations for your senior care facility scenario:
Developer Account Setup
Amazon Account: A single Amazon account can register and manage up to 100+ Alexa devices (there's no hard limit).
Device Groups: You can organize devices into groups for easier management.
Development Skills: Skills in development mode can be accessed on all devices registered to the same Amazon account.
Deployment Options for 100 Apartments
Option 1: Single Account Management
Register all 100 Echo devices to a single Amazon account
Deploy your skill in development mode
All devices will have access to the skill
Pros: Simplest setup, easiest management
Cons: Privacy concerns as all device data goes to same account
Option 2: Multi-Account Management with Beta Testing
Create separate Amazon accounts for groups of apartments
Deploy your skill as a beta test
Invite all those accounts as beta testers
Pros: Better privacy separation
Cons: More complex management, 90-day beta period limitation
Option 3: Alexa for Business
Use Alexa for Business to deploy to multiple devices
Create a private skill for your organization
Pros: Professional management features, better data separation
Cons: Additional costs, more complex setup
Key Considerations
Privacy: Consider whether residents should have separate accounts for privacy.
Data Collection: How you'll collect research data from 100 separate devices.
Maintenance: How you'll update the skill across all devices.
Internet Requirements: All devices will need stable WiFi.
For a research project in a senior care facility, Option 1 (single account) is likely the most practical approach if you're primarily concerned with deployment simplicity.
